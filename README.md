Hello World!

My name is Franco Buhay. An amateur programmer of sorts, I'm just now getting into coding and can't
wait to log all of my projects and the like. It'll be fun to track my progress using this website as
a homebase of sorts. Please don't hesitate to comment on my code as I'm using this as a way to improve
myself as a programmer. For you veterans out there, if you have any suggestions about formatting or
best practices, please let me know.

For the most part, I will be programming in C#, R and Python. However, as I learn more and more Scala,
I hope to include some of those projects as well.

Happy Coding!
Franco
